# Choose Your Own Adventure
In this project, you’ll use logic and conditional statements to write a classic text-based Choose Your Own Adventure Game. Depending on what choices your user makes, the program will have a different result. If you’re interested in game development, this is a great project to get your started! While we’re only working with text, the principles of user input and control flow are used to build even highly advanced games.

We’ve provided you with a template to write a game, but we highly encourage you to take what you’ve learned here and use your creativity to write an original game, either here on Codecademy or off-platform!

# Instructions:

Let’s run the program! Save the program. Then, in the terminal, type the following command and press Enter: "dotnet run"

Try different options. When you hit the end of the program, re-run it and make a different decision than you did before. Keep doing that until you’ve gone through all the possible endings to make sure your program looks correct, no matter what options your user chooses.

If you are feeling ambitious, here are some extensions:

Modify the story and the code to create your very own Choose Your Adventure
Include more cases to check for other user input (what if a user picks a choice you didn’t include?)
Use ternary operators
